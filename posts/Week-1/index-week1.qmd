This is your first blog post. It may take you a while to get comfortable with the construction of these Quarto (`.qmd`) documents. Take it easy until you do. And when you need help, **ask for help!**

I encourage a style where each R chunk has a `label=` which is set to a more-or-less random sequence of letters and numbers. This makes it easier, when there is a problem compiling a document, to locate the chunk that is causing an error.

```{r label="W1-ehsl32d"}
1 + 1
```
